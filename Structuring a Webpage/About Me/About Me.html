            <h2> I was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia.</h2>
            <h2> I live with my parents, sister, 3 dogs, and 2 cats.</h2>
            <h2> In high school I did theatre but I mostly stayed behind the scenes and did stage managing.</h2>
            <h2> The sports teams that I follow are the New York Mets and Giants.</h2>
            <h2> I support these teams because my dad is from New York so we go there a lot.</h2>
            <h2> I also watch a lot of University of Richmond basketball with my family.</h2>
            <h2> Some things I love to do in my free time are watch movies with my friends, nap, and get coffee at Oak House.</h2>
            <h2> I eat cereal for breakfast almost every morning and my favorite are Froot Loops and Lucky Charms.</h2>
            <h2> My sister is a junior at James Madison University where she is a Psychology Major.</h2>
            <h2> Good thing JMU is no longer in the same conference as Elon so I don't have to hear about how we lost to JMU from my sister!</h2>
            <h2> My dogs are named Luna, Cole, and Shea and the cats are Mookie and Freddie.</h2>
            <h2> My Major is Cinema and Telvision Arts with a Minor in Sport Management.</h2>
            <h2> At home I work at my local sandwich shop called Taste. I have been working there for over 2 years. </h2>
